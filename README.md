üéÆ The realm of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) plays a pivotal role in the development of efficient software systems. For our four-credit "Data Structures and Algorithms" course, which contributes to our degree, we have chosen to design and implement a problem-solving application that focuses on optimizing algorithmic performance using various data structures. This project allows us to deepen our understanding of essential concepts such as trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and sorting algorithms.
Our goal is to build a system that not only performs efficiently but also adapts to varying complexities in input size and problem constraints. Through this project, we aim to improve our problem-solving and coding skills while also applying theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. The project will challenge us to optimize solutions, analyze time and space complexity, and ultimately refine our understanding of algorithmic design. It also provides an opportunity to collaborate with peers to tackle real-world computational challenges and test our skills in a comprehensive, hands-on way.
## üó°Ô∏è General
Our inspiration comes from classic puzzle games and maze-solving challenges, with a modern twist. We sought to combine the thrill of problem-solving and spatial awareness seen in iconic games like Tetris and Maze Runner while implementing innovative programming techniques to enhance the player experience.
In our game, players navigate through various mazes while also solving Tetris-like puzzles, blending strategy, timing, and spatial reasoning into a single cohesive experience. We have incorporated several key improvements to ensure the game is both challenging and engaging:
Game Balance and Difficulty Adjustments: We have carefully tuned the difficulty levels of both the maze and Tetris puzzles, ensuring that players are constantly challenged but not overwhelmed.
Enhanced Visuals and Audio: The game now features polished graphics, along with immersive sound effects and background music to heighten the overall gaming experience.
Efficient Game Mechanics: By leveraging advanced object-oriented programming concepts, such as the factory pattern and strategy pattern, we have ensured that the game is not only fun but also scalable and maintainable.
This project is designed to appeal to players of all skill levels, offering both casual gameplay and more complex challenges as players advance.
